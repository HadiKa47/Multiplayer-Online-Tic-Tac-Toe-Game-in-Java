<p> This project implements a multiplayer, online Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java, showcasing fundamental concepts such as TCP networking, 
  rendering optimization with Graphics2D and renderingHints, and advanced object-oriented programming techniques including method overriding. 
  The game allows multiple players to compete in real-time over a network connection,
  offering a seamless user experience through intuitive graphical interfaces and efficient network communication.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
  
<p>Networking: Utilizes TCP for reliable communication between clients and server, ensuring synchronized gameplay across multiple devices.</p>
<p>Graphics and Rendering: Enhances user interface using Graphics2D with advanced rendering hints for smooth and visually appealing gameplay.</p>
<p>Object-Oriented Design: Demonstrates effective use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to maintain clean and extensible code.</p>
<p>HTML Integration: Incorporates HTML for client-side user interfaces, enhancing accessibility and customization options within the Eclipse IDE environment.</p>
<p>Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed for compatibility across various operating systems, leveraging Java's platform independence.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>Server Setup: Run the server component to host the game.</p>
<p>Client Connection: Connect multiple clients to the server to initiate gameplay sessions.</p>  
<p>Gameplay: Enjoy real-time Tic-Tac-Toe matches with friends or random opponents over the network.</p>
<p>
  This project serves as an educational resource and practical example for learning networked multiplayer game development in Java,
  covering both basic and advanced concepts in a comprehensive manner.
